Why Rutherford was wrong about the atom model?

Link to this: [rutherford-atom](#rutherford-atom-model)

A Rutherford atom model is the combination of protons and electrons to
give us a neutral nucleus.

Question 1: What is the energy of the electron if we confine it inside
the nucleus? Consider only the kinetic energy due to uncertainty
principle is enough to construct a contradiction.

Question 2: From the point of view of nuclear magnetic moment, the
electron magnetic moment is way to large. Measurement tells us that
nuclei usually have nuclear magnetic moment $-3\mu_N$ to $10\mu_N$ where
$\mu_N=e\hbar/2m_p$ and $m_p$ is the mass of proton.

Hint: The magnetic moment is of the magnitude $e\hbar/2m_x$.
