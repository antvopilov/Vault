Blazers in astrophysics

Blazers has a very large apparant velocity, which is usually much larger
than speed of light, eg, 34c.

This problem is very nicely explained on this page: [Apparent
Superluminal Velocity of
Galaxies](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/Superluminal/superluminal.html)
.
